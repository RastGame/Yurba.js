# Chat with bot
Greetings! There's not much left to do. To communicate with the bot and have some interactions with it, you need to create a group.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're going to create a group, it's preferable to do it from the bot's account (but not mandatory), as it will have all the rights. Unfortunately, at this time Yurba.one doesn't have the ability to grant users admin/moderator rights or create any roles in channels/groups.

## As a result, there will be 2 users in the group - you and your bot.
