# Repositories

## Improving any repository
If you want to improve your repository, as you plan to make it public or work with other people - then it won't hurt to create a simple `README.md` that will immediately explain everything and make others understand about the project, as well as create a `LICENSE` to preserve your copyrights or provide specific rules about it.

### Creating a Readme
There is nothing difficult in creating a Readme - but after it, a lot changes. For example, imagine you go to the [Yurba.js repository](https://github.com/yurbajs/yurba.js/) and there is no Readme - you might have some vague understanding about the library from the description and categories - but what it does and how to use it - no.
But when you visit it, you immediately see everything you need (although it depends on who you are and what your purpose is), like the logo and quick information about the project through badges created with [shields.io](https://shields.io/)
For example, the version of the main library, downloads, release, latest tests, latest commit, contributing, and even the latest library update. And this already gives a lot. After that, you see About with brief information, then the packages in the project, their versions, links, and so on. Because of this, you don't need to go anywhere to search but see everything right away.

Today, using the guide bot as an example, I will show you how to create a simple Readme for your project.
Most likely you will have a question - where to start?
